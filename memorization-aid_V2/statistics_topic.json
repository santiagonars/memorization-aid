    "What is a trick for matrix multiplication?": "The output matrix will consist of all values in the rows and columns where the input matrices cross",
    "What are the 2 types of descriptive statistics?": "1) Observations in a variable. 2) The spread of a variable.",
    "What are some of the observations in a variable?": "Mean, medium, mode, and sum",
    "What are some ways to describe the spread of a variable?": "Variance, standard deviation, counts, and quartiles",
    "What are the measurements of central tendency?": "Mean, medium, mode (The 3 Ms)",
    "What are the measurements of dispersion?": "Variance, Standard deviation, and quartiles",
    "What Python library is used for performing statistical analysis?": "Scipy",
    "What is variance?": "How far are all points from the mean or center",
    "What is the mathematical definition of the variance?": "The sum of squared distances for each point to the mean",
    "What is standard deviation?": "The square root of the variance",
    "When is standard deviation more beneficial?": "When using units (also for business cases)",
    "What is Bessel's correction?": "An approach to reduce bias (for calculating variance or STD => N or N-1)",
    "What is covariance? and what do you need to make sure to do before using covariance?": "A way to compare two variables by comparing their variances. You need to make sure to match scale or normalize the data.",
    "What is Person Correlation Coefficient? and how does it work?": "A common way to show relationship between two variables. It normalizes the values coming from two different distributions to always between -1 and +1",
    "What is a simple way to describe the equation of the Person Correlation Coefficient?": "The covariance of the two variables divided by the standard deviation of each of the variables"
